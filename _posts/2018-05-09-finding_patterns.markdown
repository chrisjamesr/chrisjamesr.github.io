Once I hit project mode at the end of a module I tend to go off into the weeds. For those of us working through the curriculum part-time, budgeting available time is a challenge. Weighing the benefits of reading a few relevant blog posts on a topic versus actual coursework is a very real consideration when you only have an hour or two to spare in an evening. Portfolio projects are an opportunity to expand and deepen one’s understanding of a topic, to break and refactor and consider code in a way that can be truly immersive. 

My biggest hangup coding has always been whether or not I’m doing something the right way. During my time adding JQuery to my rails project I spent hours reading about patterns. I had been putting this off for a while, partially because I wanted to be able to give the topic the appropriate attention. The idea of a pattern in programming felt like something esoteric that I was not yet qualified to explore. In reality, a pattern is just a solution to a common issue, an easily repeatable way to handle data or interactions with data, that is proven to be concise and efficient. 

While building this project I did not have the working familiarity to deliberately implement much of what I had read. I did however review my code to identify some of the common named patterns that I had unknowingly because it seemed like the best way to solve a problem. Taking a short break from the coursework to dive into a topic can help one reflect on the work that they’re doing while still making demonstrable progress.
