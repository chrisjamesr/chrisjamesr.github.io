    I love to know how things work. I'm moved by the desire to take something apart and figure out why and how it does whatever it does.   I was the kid who stuck a fork in the electrical socket. I did it more than once. I dismantled the VCR, the vacuum, and the stereo and managed to reassemble them without any "extra" pieces left over. Eventually I became a professional tradesman and learned to build, and troubleshoot electrical, communications, and life safety systems. From there I moved on to designing, estimating and designing those same systems. While the change was certainly educational, I've miss the sheer joy of building. Learning to code feels the next logical step.

     I've tried to teach myself how to code multiple times over the course of the last few years, however I was never able to organize what I had learned into a body of knowledge that I could use in a meaningful way. I've always considered myself a proud autodidact who could master new skills on my own with whatever resources were available but the world of coding seems enormous and impossible to navigate. Giving up on my quest to figure it out on my own has been one of the best decisions I've ever made.
